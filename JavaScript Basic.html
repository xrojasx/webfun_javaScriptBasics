                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>JacaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting lenguage. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and
                    lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
                    enviroment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these enviroments to provide progmmatic control over
                    them.

                            <a href="variabledec.html">Variable Declaration</a>  JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - images a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
                            a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x;
                        </p>
                    </li>

                            <a href="varassig.html"> Variable Assignment</a>  Assignment operators assign values to JacaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our
                            variable a value to hold. The = assignment opeator assigns a value to the varibale. var x = 10;

                            <a href="datatypes.html">Data Types</a>  Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types
                            that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!";
                            Array - [1,'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}

                            <a href="conditionals.html">Conditionals</a>  When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on
                            values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
                            conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else to specify a new condition to test, if the first
                            condition is false; else we execute ths block of code;
                        </p>

                            <a href="loops.html">Loops</a>  There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat
                            an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four time and then you stop. Thats a loop!
                        </p>

                            <a href="Function">Function</a>  Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this wll run that code block. Think of it as a list of
                        instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we
                        screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more
                        tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
